# wordlister
A simple Python based wordlist rescoring tool for Windows

You will need to pip install PyQt5 and pandas dependencies

Edit the config.ini to specify the path to your master wordlist (such as SpreadTheWordlist) that you want to rescore (this file will be left read only), your personal wordlist (where the output of the rescoring will be stored), and the rescore tracker (point this to the same directory as wordlister.py and it will be created on first run).

Add the icons directory as a sub-directory to the wordlister.py file. 

You can change the word lengths, scores and wordlist locations in the settings menu. The keys to rescore are displayed onscreen.
